# birthday-wrangler.py
A data wrangler using python to crawl, sift, and store birthday dates of well known people from date pages on Wikipedia.

This was a project that I've done previously with PHP. Here, I develop the same project with Python. This is an exercise for me to learn about http interfacing with **requests** and text parsing.
